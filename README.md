**Examining Trends in Exoplanetary Transit Probabilities by Transit Multiplicity**

This repository contains a suite of scripts which plot data that can be used to examine how exoplanet transit probabilities change over time by multiplicity. The code generates plots which examine how transit probabilities change over time, how the expected number of transits change over time, how the total variations in expected transits are distributed across the entire population, how transit probabilities at different multiplicities are correlated, and how the expected number of transits by transit mulitplicity compares to the data obtained by the ***Kepler Space Telelscope***.

The data used in this repository was generated by finding around a thousand systems that were best fits to the observed Kepler multi-transitiing systems using a code called SysSim, integrating these systems forwards in time 1 Myr using a code called REBOUND, and measuring the transit probabilities by multiplicity (e.g. the probability of seeing 2-planets transit, 3-planets transit, etc.) at each timestep using a code called CORBITS. The entire dataset has been withheld from this repository, but some data has been included for demonstration purposes.
