# Multiplicity-Expectation-Values
Generates plots of multiplicity transit-probability expectation values vs. time. Also contains the data for doing so.

Note that the spikes on many of the plots are not plotting errors. This was confirmed by hand. See the following calculation, which used data from sysSym_0_randomO.csv at timestep 220122 (variable v = expectation value calculated by hand, z = expecatation value from code): https://www.desmos.com/calculator/s0zmukkvt3
